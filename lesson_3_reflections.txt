When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When you work with more people on a project or when you want to access your work from different locations. It is also safer to have your work on GitHub, if your computer crashes it's still there.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-the history is clearer. You may not want your remote repository on Git.
